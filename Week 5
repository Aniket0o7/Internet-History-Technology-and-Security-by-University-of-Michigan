1 / 1 point

Satellite


Optical


Smartphones


DVD players

Correct
Satellite && Optical

2.
Question 2
 When do wireless devices receive their serial numbers (i.e. MAC or Ethernet addresses)? 

1 / 1 point

Every time they connect to the internet


When they pair with a wireless router


These numbers are assigned to individual people, and every device they own has the same number


When they are manufactured

Correct

When they are manufactured

3.
Question 3
What does the time taken for a packet to reach a destination usually reflect? 

1 / 1 point

How large the total message or data element is


How much the individual user sending the information has paid for their internet connection


The speed of light and the distance the packet has to travel


The type of data the packet makes up

Correct
The speed of light and the distance the packet has to travel

4.
Question 4
How do wireless devices operating on a shared network determine when to send information so as not to incur chaos? 

1 / 1 point

They send requests to all other devices on the network, and wait to receive permission before transmitting data. 


There is only one link to the network, and only one wireless device can connect at a time, so they are physically prevented from sending information unless it is their turn. 


They listen to the sound on the current network, and send information when it is quiet. 


They chart energy usage, and send information when the numbers are low

Correct

They listen to the sound on the current network, and send information when it is quiet. 

5.
Question 5
What is the concern when deciding which device sends information next on Ethernet? 

1 / 1 point

Discouraging the sending of large messages by delaying their transmission in favor of smaller, faster messages


Sending the most urgent emails before less important messages (like Farmville notifications)


Ensuring fairness - that one type of device, data, or user is not preferred over others. 


Prioritizing the customers who purchase premium internet plans

Correct
Ensuring fairness - that one type of device, data, or user is not preferred over others. 

6.
Question 6
What is the maximum possible number of hops a packet can take to try to reach their destination (the so-called "Time To Live" functionality of packets)? 

1 / 1 point

255


4


150


500

Correct
255

7.
Question 7
What are Router Tables? 

1 / 1 point

Huge banks of routers, housed by Google, that direct Internet traffic


Dynamic lists of directions for where and how to direct packets


A linked trio of routers that manages incoming, outgoing, and within-network data transmissions. 


An electrically enhanced table that, when you place a router on it, will increase your network speed

Correct
Dynamic lists of directions for where and how to direct packets

8.

What is the Internet Protocol Layer responsible for? 

1 / 1 point

Being 100% reliable


Getting a packet to a specific network address


Moving the packet onto the link


Managing the order of data transmission from multiple computers on a wireless network

Correct

Getting a packet to a specific network address

10.
Question 10
How is an IP address determined? 

1 / 1 point

By the hour in which the computer was most recently turned on


Geographically


By the date in which the owner first got an email account


According to product manufacturing date

Correct

11.
Question 11
The prefix of an IP address determines what? 

1 / 1 point

The brand of computer


The network that it belongs to


The owner of the computer


The default web browser installed

Correct
The network that it belongs to

12.
Question 12
What is the Link Layer responsible for? 

1 / 1 point

Assigning domain names like www.coursera.org


Pulling the data from a single link


Storing each packet until it has been acknowledged for delivery


Reporting which packets successfully arrived at their destination

Correct

Pulling the data from a single link

13.
Question 13
Is it possible to track a packet's journey across the network? 

1 / 1 point

No, packets cannot be tracked. 


Yes, using a technique called 'traceroute' which tracks the packets that are returned due to transmission failure. 


Yes, using a service called 'packetfind' that tracks the transmission of all packets across the Internet. 


Yes, using RIP (Router Information Protocol) which tracks the packets that successfully arrive at their destination. 

Correct

Yes, using a technique called 'traceroute' which tracks the packets that are returned due to transmission failure.
