Question 1
Which of the following is true of security?

1 / 1 point

Perfect security is achievable and cheap


Perfect security is unachievable but you should always choose the most expensive option


Perfect security is achievable but expensive


Perfect security is unachievable and requires a trade-off with cost

Correct
Perfect security is unachievable and requires a trade-off with cost

Question 2
What is the difference between active and passive wiretapping?

0 / 1 point

Passive wiretapping and active wiretapping are different names for network snooping


In active wiretapping the network is snooped whereas in passive wiretapping the network is altered


In passive wiretapping the network is snooped whereas in active wiretapping the network data is altered


In passive wiretapping only some of the network data is altered where in active wiretapping all of the network data is altered

Incorrect
In passive wiretapping only some of the network data is altered where in active wiretapping all of the network data is altered

1 / 1 point

Public-key cryptosystems can transmit more data than secret-key ones


Public-key cryptosystems are always more secure than secret-key ones


Public-key cryptosystems do not have the problem of secure key distribution

Question 6
What does it mean if a cryptosystem is symmetric-key in nature?

1 / 1 point

The key used for encryption is the backward version of the key used for decryption


The key used for encryption is the same as the key used for decryption


The key used for encryption is the from the key used for decryption but with a shared secret added to the end


Correct

The key used for encryption is a shortened version of the key used for decryption

Question 10
What does a cryptographic hash function do?

1 / 1 point

It converts input fixed-size bit strings into blocks of data


It takes a block of data and returns a fixed-size bit string called the hash value


It takes a block of data and randomly changes characters to numbers


It computes the Hyperbolic Asymmetric Sine Harmonic (H.A.S.H.) for a sequence of audio data

Correct


It takes a block of data and returns a fixed-size bit string called the hash value11.
Question 11
What critical element does simple digest-based Message Signing, as described in the lecture, depend upon?

1 / 1 point

The secret should not be longer than the message


The sharing of a secret transported securely ‘out of band’


The message must be under 20 characters long


Correct


The geographic proximity of the transmitter and recipient of the message12.
Question 12
What is the problem with secret key distribution via the internet?

1 / 1 point

There is no problem


The internet is too slow for sending keys


The communication of the secret key is insecure


The internet cannot handle the length of shared secret keys because they are longer than a single packet

Correct

The communication of the secret key is insecure
